# Prompt Playground CLI

A command-line tool for experimenting with AI prompts, saving them as reusable templates, and tracking interaction results via the [Groq API](https://console.groq.com).

Type prompts in a chat-style loop, reuse saved templates, and export a full history of every interaction.

## Features

- **Chat loop** — Send prompts and get AI responses with token usage
- **Streaming** — Optional token-by-token output via `/stream on`
- **Chain of thought** — Optional `<thinking>` / `<answer>` sections via `/cot on`
- **Templates** — Save, load, list, and delete named prompts
- **Logging** — Auto-log every interaction (prompt, full response, parsed CoT fields, model, tokens, timestamp)
- **Export** — Download history as JSON or CSV
- **Settings** — Switch models, temperature, max tokens, system prompt, CoT, and streaming per session

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A free [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Enter the project
cd PromptPlaygroundCLI

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set: GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run
python3 playground.py
```

## How to Use

The app starts directly in a **slash-command chat loop**. Type a normal message to chat with the AI, or use `/commands` for everything else.

### Basic chat

Default mode uses **blocking** output (full response printed at once). CoT and streaming are both off.

```
Prompt Playground v1.0
Type /help for commands

You: What is the capital of France?
AI: Paris is the capital of France.
   Tokens: 12 | Model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

### Streaming only

Enable incremental token output without CoT:

```
You: /stream on
Streaming: on

You: What is the capital of France?
AI: Paris is the capital of France.
   Tokens: 12 | Model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile | Stream: on
```

With streaming on, text appears token-by-token after the green `AI:` prefix instead of waiting for the full reply.

### Chain of thought only

Enable structured reasoning sections without streaming (blocking display):

```
You: /cot on
Chain of thought: on

You: What is 15% of 80?

Thinking:
To find 15% of 80, multiply 80 by 0.15: 80 × 0.15 = 12.

Answer:
12
   Tokens: 187 | Model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile | CoT: on
```

### Chain of thought and streaming together

Both features are **off by default** and can be toggled independently:

```
You: /cot on
Chain of thought: on

You: /stream on
Streaming: on

You: What is 15% of 80?

Thinking:
Let me calculate 15% of 80. 15% = 0.15, so 0.15 × 80 = 12.

Answer:
15% of 80 is 12.
   Tokens: 45 | Model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile | CoT: on | Stream: on
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cot` | Toggle chain-of-thought mode |
| `/cot on` / `/cot off` | Enable or disable CoT explicitly |
| `/stream` | Toggle streaming output |
| `/stream on` / `/stream off` | Enable or disable streaming explicitly |

With CoT enabled, the app injects a system prompt that asks the model to respond using `<thinking>` and `<answer>` XML tags. Thinking is shown in cyan; the final answer in green. If the model omits tags, the full response is shown with a warning.

With streaming enabled, tokens print as they arrive instead of waiting for the full response. CoT sections also stream incrementally when both features are on.

**Notes:**
- `/cot` and `/stream` can be combined or used alone.
- Settings apply for the current session only (not saved between restarts).
- Press **Ctrl+C** during a stream to cancel; partial responses are not logged.

### Save and reuse prompts

```
You: Explain recursion in one sentence.
AI: Recursion is when a function calls itself...

You: /save recursion_one_liner
Saved as "recursion_one_liner"

You: /list
Saved templates:
  1. recursion_one_liner: Explain recursion in one sentence.

You: /load recursion_one_liner
Loaded "recursion_one_liner": Explain recursion in one sentence.
```

`/load` shows a preview only — it does **not** auto-send to the API. Type your prompt after loading, or send a new one.

### Change settings

```
You: /config
```

You will be prompted to update:

| Setting | How to change |
|---------|---------------|
| Model | `1` = mixtral, `2` = llama2, `3` = gemma (or type the key name) |
| Temperature | Float between `0.0` and `2.0` |
| Max tokens | Positive integer |
| System prompt | Any text, or `clear` to remove |
| Chain of thought | `on` or `off` |
| Streaming | `on` or `off` |

Press **Enter** on any prompt to keep the current value.

### View and export history

```
You: /history
Recent interactions:
  [13:45] — -> "Paris is the capital of France."
  [14:20] — -> "12"
```

For CoT responses, `/history` shows the parsed **answer** when available; otherwise it shows the full response.

```
You: /export
Export format (json/csv) [json]: csv
Logs exported to logs_2026-07-04.csv
```

### Exit

```
You: /exit
Goodbye!
```

Or press **Ctrl+C** at any time.

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/save <name>` | Save your last sent prompt as a template |
| `/load <name>` | Load a template (preview only, sets logging context) |
| `/list` | List all saved templates |
| `/delete <name>` | Delete a template |
| `/history` | Show the 10 most recent interactions |
| `/export` | Export all logs to JSON or CSV |
| `/config` | Change model, temperature, tokens, system prompt, CoT, streaming |
| `/cot [on\|off]` | Toggle chain-of-thought mode |
| `/stream [on\|off]` | Toggle streaming output |

## Models

| Key | Groq Model ID | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| `mixtral` | `qwen/qwen3-32b` | Fast, capable general model |
| `llama2` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Default — strong all-round model |
| `gemma` | `llama-3.1-8b-instant` | Lightweight, fast responses |

Switch models during a session with `/config`.

## Data Files

All data is stored at the **project root** (next to `playground.py`), regardless of your current working directory.

| File | Created when | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `templates.json` | First `/save` | Saved prompt templates |
| `logs.json` | First chat message | Full interaction history |
| `logs_YYYY-MM-DD.json` | `/export` (JSON) | Exported log snapshot |
| `logs_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` | `/export` (CSV) | Exported log snapshot |

### `templates.json` format

```json
{
  "geography_question": "What is the capital of France?",
  "recursion_one_liner": "Explain recursion in one sentence."
}
```

### `logs.json` entry format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-07-04 13:45:00",
  "template": "geography_question",
  "user": "What is the capital of France?",
  "response": "Paris is the capital of France.",
  "thinking": null,
  "answer": null,
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "tokens": 12,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "cot_enabled": false,
  "stream_enabled": false
}
```

`response` always stores the **full raw** AI text (including XML tags when CoT is used). `thinking` and `answer` are populated when CoT tags are present. `template` is `null` when no template was loaded for that interaction.

CoT example entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-07-04 14:20:00",
  "template": null,
  "user": "What is 15% of 80?",
  "response": "<thinking>80 × 0.15 = 12</thinking><answer>12</answer>",
  "thinking": "80 × 0.15 = 12",
  "answer": "12",
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "tokens": 187,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "cot_enabled": true,
  "stream_enabled": false
}
```

CSV exports include all fields listed above.

## Architecture (summary)

The app uses a **layered package** design:

| Layer | Location | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| Entry | `playground.py` | Thin launcher |
| CLI | `prompt_playground/cli/` | REPL, slash commands, `CotParser`, `StreamRenderer` |
| Services | `prompt_playground/services/` | Business logic, Groq adapter (`send` / `send_stream`) |
| Storage | `prompt_playground/storage/` | JSON file repositories |
| Config | `prompt_playground/config.py`, `models.py` | Constants and shared state |

```
playground.py → PromptPlaygroundApp → CommandHandler / ChatService
                                    → StreamRenderer (display)
                                    → TemplateService / LogService
                                    → TemplateStore / LogStore → *.json
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY not set` | Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your key |
| `API error: Invalid API Key` | Check your key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) |
| Streaming shows empty `AI:` with `Tokens: 0` | Ensure dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). Streaming requires a working Groq API connection. |
| `CoT tags not found in response` | The model ignored the format; try again or switch models via `/config` |
| `no prompt to save` | Send a chat message before using `/save` |
| `template not found` | Use `/list` to see available template names |
| `python: command not found` | Use `python3` instead |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: prompt_playground` | Run from project root; ensure `playground.py` is present |
